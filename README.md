## Abstract

In this paper, we present a novel neural network using multi scale feature fusion at
various scales for accurate and efficient semantic image segmentation. We have
used dilated convolutional layers in downsampling part, transposed convolutional
layers in the upsampling part and used concat layers to merge them. We used skip
connections in between alternate blocks which are comprised of convolutional and
max pooling layers. We present an in depth theoretical analysis of our network
with training and optimization details. We evaluated our network on the Camvid
dataset using mean accuracy per class and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the
evaluation metrics on the test set. Our model outperforms previous state of the
art networks on semantic segmentation achieving mean IOU value of 74.12 while
running at >100 FPS.

## Data
